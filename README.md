Trajectory Analysis  

## Programs:
linear.ipynb: linear implementation of trajectory recovery
* dataset stored in a 2D array of trajectories, each of which has has their own sequence of points based on csv file
* already made up to finding MAE, but with hardcoded test data
* errors: changes to array, shallow copy potential problems, mutability
* todo: try code with random and bigger test data, check code robustness

## For learning purposes:  
grid.ipnyb: explore how to make grid  
plot.ipynb: explore plt plots  
read.ipynb: attempt to read dataset using numpy dataframe, explore 3d plot  

digits_rf.ipynb: explore rf from youtube with sklearn.datasets (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ok2s1vV9XW0)
